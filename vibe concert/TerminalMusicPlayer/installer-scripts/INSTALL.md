# Terminal Music Player - Installation Guide

Welcome! This app plays music automatically when you start Claude Code sessions.

## 📦 Installation Steps

### 1. Install the App

Drag **Terminal Music Player.app** to your **Applications** folder.

### 2. Remove Quarantine (Prevent "App is Damaged" Error)

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
sudo xattr -cr /Applications/TerminalMusicPlayer.app
```

This removes the quarantine flag that macOS adds to downloaded apps, preventing the "app is damaged" error.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
brew install yt-dlp jq
```

If you don't have Homebrew, install it first from [https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh)

### 4. Run Dependency Checker (Optional)

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
cd "/Volumes/Terminal Music Player Installer/Installation Scripts"
./Check\ Dependencies
```

Or right-click **Check Dependencies** → **Open** → Click **Open** in the dialog.

### 5. Install Claude Code Hooks

**Option A: Using Terminal (Recommended)**

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
cd "/Volumes/Terminal Music Player Installer/Installation Scripts"
./Install\ Hooks
```

**Option B: Bypass Gatekeeper**

Right-click **Install Hooks** → **Open** → Click **Open** in the dialog

---

This will:
- Create hook scripts in `~/.claude/hooks/`
- Update your Claude Code settings
- Enable automatic session detection

### 6. Launch the App

Open **Terminal Music Player** from your Applications folder.

You should see a white circle in your menu bar ⚪

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
