# ‚úÖ Video Retrieval - FIXED!

## What Was The Problem?

**Sora videos expire after 1 hour!**

Your videos had this URL:
```
https://api.openai.com/v1/videos/video_68fefdd1f26c8198b67440992b90ba600a7b1d0908f27146/download
```

But when we tried to download it:
```
"The video is no longer available. Downloads expire after 1 hours."
```

## The Solution

I built an **auto-download system** that:

1. **When Sora completes a video** ‚Üí Immediately downloads it (within the 1-hour window)
2. **Uploads to Firebase Storage** ‚Üí Permanent storage
3. **Updates the story** ‚Üí With the permanent Firebase Storage URL

Now videos will be **permanently accessible**!

## How It Works

### Before (OLD - Videos Expired):
```
Sora completes video
  ‚Üì
Sora URL saved to Firebase: https://api.openai.com/v1/videos/...
  ‚Üì
1 hour later... ‚ùå VIDEO EXPIRED
  ‚Üì
Browser can't access it
```

### After (NEW - Videos Saved Forever):
```
Sora completes video
  ‚Üì
System downloads video from Sora (within 1 hour)
  ‚Üì
Uploads to Firebase Storage
  ‚Üì
Permanent URL saved: https://storage.googleapis.com/day-story-2bca8.firebasestorage.app/videos/video_abc123.mp4
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ VIDEO ACCESSIBLE FOREVER
  ‚Üì
Browser can play it directly
```

## What I Built

### 1. Video Storage System (`lib/videoStorage.ts`)
- Downloads video from Sora API
- Uploads to Firebase Storage
- Makes file publicly accessible
- Returns permanent URL

### 2. Updated Video Generation Route
- When Sora job completes
- Automatically calls `downloadAndStoreVideo()`
- Updates story with permanent URL
- If download fails (expired), marks video as failed

---

## Testing The Fix

### Your old videos are gone (expired)
The existing videos in your Firebase database have **expired** Sora URLs. You need to generate **new videos** to test this.

### Generate a NEW video:

1. **Start dev server** (if not running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Go to dashboard**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3002/dashboard
   ```

3. **Create a new DayStory**:
   - Pick a date
   - Choose character
   - Let it generate

4. **Watch the console logs**:
   ```
   [Sora] Checking job status for: video_abc123
   [Sora] Job status response: { status: 'completed' }
   [API] Video completed for job: video_abc123
   [API] Downloading and storing video...
   [VideoStorage] Downloaded 2845123 bytes
   [VideoStorage] Uploaded to Firebase Storage: videos/video_abc123.mp4
   [VideoStorage] Public URL: https://storage.googleapis.com/...
   [API] Video stored successfully
   ```

5. **Video should appear in dashboard** with permanent URL!

## Verification

After generating a new video:

### Check 1: Video Shows in Dashboard
- Should see video thumbnail
- Hover to preview
- Click to view full video

### Check 2: Check Firebase
Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí stories ‚Üí [your story]

Should see:
```
status: "completed"
videoProvider: "sora"
videoUrl: "https://storage.googleapis.com/day-story-2bca8.firebasestorage.app/videos/video_abc123.mp4"
videoJobId: null (cleared after successful download)
```

### Check 3: Check Firebase Storage
Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí videos folder

Should see:
```
video_abc123.mp4 (the downloaded video file)
```

## What About My Old Videos?

Your old videos are **permanently expired** from Sora (after 1 hour). You have two options:

### Option 1: Keep Them (No Video)
- Leave them as-is
- They'll show "Script Ready" status
- Can view the script but no video

### Option 2: Regenerate
- Delete the old stories
- Create new ones
- New system will save videos properly

I recommend **Option 2** - start fresh with the new auto-download system.

---

## How To Delete Old Stories

If you want to clean up the expired videos:

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Firestore Database ‚Üí stories collection
3. Delete the stories with `videoProvider: "sora"` and old `videoUrl` URLs
4. Or just leave them - they won't cause any issues

---

## Success Checklist

When you generate a NEW video, you should see:

- [‚úì] Console shows `[VideoStorage] Downloaded X bytes`
- [‚úì] Console shows `[VideoStorage] Uploaded to Firebase Storage`
- [‚úì] Console shows `[API] Video stored successfully`
- [‚úì] Dashboard shows video thumbnail
- [‚úì] Video plays when you hover over it
- [‚úì] Firebase Storage has the video file
- [‚úì] Firebase Firestore has permanent storage URL

---

## Ready To Test?

Just run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then go create a **new DayStory** and watch the magic happen! üé¨‚ú®

The video will be:
- ‚úÖ Downloaded automatically
- ‚úÖ Stored permanently in Firebase
- ‚úÖ Accessible forever
- ‚úÖ Playable in browser

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Error: "Video expired or download failed"
- Means the video took longer than 1 hour to complete
- Or Sora API had an issue
- Just try generating a new video

### Error: "Failed to download video from Sora"
- Check your Sora API key is correct
- Check Firebase Storage is configured
- Look at server console for detailed error

### Video doesn't show in dashboard
- Check browser console for errors
- Check server console for errors
- Verify Firebase Storage bucket is set: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=day-story-2bca8.firebasestorage.app`

---

## Technical Details

### Storage Location
Videos are stored in Firebase Storage at:
```
gs://day-story-2bca8.firebasestorage.app/videos/video_abc123.mp4
```

Public URL:
```
https://storage.googleapis.com/day-story-2bca8.firebasestorage.app/videos/video_abc123.mp4
```

### Auto-Download Timing
- Sora completes video ‚Üí `status: "completed"`
- System immediately downloads (within seconds)
- 1 hour window is plenty of time
- Video stays in Firebase Storage forever

### Cost
- Firebase Storage: ~$0.026/GB/month
- A 10-second video is ~2MB
- 100 videos = ~$0.005/month
- Basically free! üéâ
