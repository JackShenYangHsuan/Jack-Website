            <p>People worry about getting married too young. They're measuring the wrong thing.</p>

            <p>I got engaged at 26—not because I'd reached some magic age, but because I'd built a framework for the decision and my partner met every criterion.</p>

            <p>The framework: Marriage is 50% finding the right person and 50% committing to hard work.</p>

            <p>The right person has three qualities. Complementary personalities that balance your weaknesses. Common values that align on what matters. Willingness to commit to each other's goals, not just your own.</p>

            <p>The hard work requires two capabilities. Team problem-solving through clear communication. Resilience to stay committed through hardship, not just enjoy the easy wins.</p>

            <p>After seven years together, my wife scores perfectly across every dimension. We share core values. Our personalities fit without friction. We've solved problems together through every challenge we've faced.</p>

            <p>The real question isn't "Am I too young?" It's "Have I found the right person, and am I ready to do the work?"</p>

            <p>I answered yes to both. The privilege of finding her early just means more years to build something extraordinary together.</p>
