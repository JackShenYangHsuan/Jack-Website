        <div class="content">
            <p>I recently turned down a team with strong learning potential. The reason was simple: the leaders were uninspiring.</p>

            <p>I had no direct experience with them, so I connected the dots from multiple sources. Nobody had anything positive to say about their integrity, inspiration, or leadership. What remained was strong industry knowledge combined with stories of burnout and hierarchical culture.</p>

            <p>The pattern was clear enough. I passed.</p>

            <p>Early in my career, I learned that uninspiring people ruin everything—no matter how interesting the work. You can be passionate about the industry and excited about the problems, but the wrong people make you miserable, unfulfilled, and stuck.</p>

            <p>Exceptional leaders create the opposite effect. They bring joy, belonging, and inspiration. They help you reach your potential instead of blocking it.</p>

            <p>When choosing what to work on, gather new information continuously. Consider it alongside your goals. Compare different outcomes. Find the balance between sacrificing negatives for positives.</p>

            <p>But on people, don't compromise. That's the decision that shapes all the others.</p>
