                    <li>GPT-5 (for writing scene prompts)</li>
                    <li>Sora (for creating the video clips)</li>

                <h2>How it works</h2>
                <h3>Step 1: Write scene prompts (GPT-5)</h3>
                <p>Break your story into scenes. For each scene, ask GPT-5 to write a video prompt and a narration prompt. Keep character details consistent across scenes.</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Create video clips (Sora)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a project in Sora and add all your scene prompts</li>
                    <li>Use landscape format (16:9), 15 seconds, Pixar style, medium motion</li>
                    <li>Redo any clips that don't look right</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Step 3: Edit the video (CapCut)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Import all clips and trim them</li>
                    <li>Add auto-captions and fix any mistakes</li>
                    <li>Add transitions and export</li>

                        <h3>Scene 1 - The Summer Factory</h3>
                        <div class="scene-label">Video prompt</div>
                        <p>Vibrant Pixar-style animation. Twelve-year-old Taiwanese boy named Jack in his father's small women's-shoe factory. The air shimmers at 35 degrees Celsius. Fans spin lazily, sewing machines clatter, dust floats in golden sunlight. Workers chat softly in Mandarin. Jack wipes sweat, carries shoe boxes, and hides an envelope labeled MacBook Fund. Camera slowly pans from steaming street to Jack's proud smile. Warm orange palette, subtle motion blur, ambient sound of leather and metal.</p>
                        <div class="scene-label">Narration</div>
                        <p>Deep, smooth baritone voice with gentle warmth-confident, intimate, like a movie trailer or luxury brand narrator. Speak slowly, with slight pauses that let emotion breathe: "Jack grew up in the thick heat of a small shoe factory in Taiwan. At twelve, he stacked boxes taller than himself as the scent of leather and glue filled the air and the old fans spun slow circles above his head. Every coin he earned for his father's shop went into his MacBook fund."</p>

                    <div class="scene-card">

                        <p>Vibrant Pixar-style animation. Jack's dim bedroom. Neon light leaks from Taipei streets through curtains. A silver laptop glows on the desk, reflecting in his eyes. Posters of white male founder heroes and circuit diagrams cover the wall. Jack types code as rain taps the window. Inspirational speeches flicker on screen. Camera circles slowly around him, showing energy and solitude. Cool blue and amber lighting, cinematic lens flare.</p>
                        <div class="scene-label">Narration</div>
                        <p>Same narrator style as Scene 1: "That laptop changed everything. Nights in Taipei turned into tiny silicon valleys in his room. He watched his heroes speak, learned English by rewinding every sentence, and filled notebooks with lines of code. He dreamt of building something with code that could impact millions."</p>

                        <p>Vibrant Pixar-style animation. Morning at National Tsing Hua University. Cherry blossoms drift through sunbeams. Students ride bikes past futuristic glass halls. Jack, in a hoodie and backpack, walks under the stone arch smiling. Cut to him in a bright computer lab, screens reflecting lines of code. Camera cranes up showing the whole campus framed by mountains. Lively orchestral music, soft pastel colors.</p>
                        <div class="scene-label">Narration</div>
                        <p>Deep baritone narration: "Years later, Jack's dream came true. He studied computer science at National Tsing Hua University. Between late-night debugging, he found joy in creation itself-discovering that code was not just logic, it was a language for imagination."</p>

                        <p>Vibrant Pixar-style animation. Cozy Taipei cafe with wooden walls, sunlight through windows. Jack and a close friend pitch to two investors. Laptops open, mock-ups displayed. One investor nods, smiles, and slides a check across the table. The boys cheer quietly. Coffee steam rises, scooters pass outside. Camera glides around them, golden afternoon light fills the room. Background chatter, upbeat string score.</p>

                        <p>Vibrant Pixar-style travel montage: Jack backpacking alone across Europe-Eiffel Tower, Swiss Alps, Italian piazzas. He struggles to take self-portraits by strangers, then sketches an app on a napkin. Transition to him coding in hostels, interface coming alive on his phone. The app is named "Frismo". App Store ranking climbs to top three, confetti animation bursts, Apple feature banner flashes. Warm global palette, dynamic transitions.</p>

                        <p>Deep baritone narration: "His startup idea came from the frustration of blurry selfies and kind strangers cutting off his head in photos while he backpacked through Europe. So he built a camera app that saw what he saw. It went viral-ranked third on the App Store with half a million downloads."</p>

                        <p>Vibrant Pixar-style animation. Nighttime in Taipei. Jack sits alone at his desk, eyes on analytics graphs falling flat. Coffee cups pile up. Outside, rain streaks the window, city lights blur. A single small plant on the desk sways under the fan. Camera zooms out slowly until Jack is a tiny figure surrounded by blue glow. Somber piano and rain sounds.</p>

                        <p>Deep baritone narration: "But downloads did not mean dollars. The charts that once climbed now refused to move. He tried subscriptions, ads, partnerships-nothing stuck. Yet somewhere behind that tired face was a quiet voice whispering: this, too, is part of the story."</p>
