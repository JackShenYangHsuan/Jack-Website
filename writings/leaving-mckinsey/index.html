            <p>Hi friends,</p>

            <p>Today marks the end of my four-year McKinsey journey, and I'm deeply grateful for the memories, the lessons, and most of all—the people.</p>

            <p>From pulling all-nighters reconciling L5 numbers to fine-tuning Excel formulas for a leaner model; from belting out '90s songs in a smoky Stuttgart KTV, to sipping Hendricks out of bowls because glasses just wouldn't do; from hunting down Asian food in the middle of El Paso, to dreaming up my marriage proposal in Tucheng team room; from one shaky 2km jog to somehow finishing a half marathon—these are the moments where work and life blurred into something beautiful and unforgettable. Where I stumbled forward, laughed hard, learned fast, and grew alongside all of you. And through it all, I found not just colleagues, but friends I'll carry far beyond this ride.</p>

            <p>Through it all, I've come to understand what leadership truly means—lifting up those around me to feel bolder and more capable of doing great things. I've learned to be resilient—pushing through self-doubt and remembering that when I feel drowned, I'm likely only a third of the way to my full potential. And I've become relentlessly resourceful—thinking from first principles, owning my path, and learning to work smart before working hard.</p>

            <p>Thank you for helping me become a more confident and humble person.</p>

            <p>Looking ahead, my wife and I are moving to the U.S. this summer, where I'll be starting my MBA and pivoting my career toward a product-building role in the tech space.</p>

            <p>Thank you for everything!</p>

            <p>Jack</p>
